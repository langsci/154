Next to the Paperhive online annotation platform, you can also download the pdf from http://langsci.github.io/154/proofreading.pdf if you prefer. Having the correction at Paperhive in a central place has proven much more convenient for the authors, but it is up to you to choose your preferred method of proofreading.

For most of the issues mentioned there, native competence is not necessary. We have every chapter checked by 2 people, at least one of which is a native speaker.

Sebastian
